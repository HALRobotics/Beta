# HAL Robotics Framework (β)
HAL Robotics Framework beta release and associated documentation.

If you want to see [what the Framework can do](https://hal-robotics.com/solutions/), check out some [case studies](https://hal-robotics.com), or take a look at its [key features](https://hal-robotics.com/technology/), head over to our [main site](https://hal-robotics.com).

## SDK Access
Please follow the instructions on our [docs site](https://docs.hal-robotics.com) to get the HAL Robotics Framework SDK for [Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/) and start programming your robots to do amazing things.

# Improvements and Bug Reports
We are continually internal testing all our software and release fixes as quickly as we can but we also appreciate being notified if you find cases we have somehow missed.
The best way for us to correct issues is to be able to reproduce them ourselves and delve into the code to see what’s going wrong.
Therefore we ask that you please refer to the [Contribution guideline](https://github.com/HALRobotics/Beta/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit any bug reports or enhancement requests through the [Issues](https://github.com/HALRobotics/Beta/issues) tab at the top of the page.

The more feedback you give, the more errors you find, the more issues you report, the better the HAL Robotics Framework gets.
