# Contributing to the HAL Robotics Framework

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the HAL Robotics Framework and its extensions.

## How Can I Contribute?

  * [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
  * [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the HAL Robotics Framework. Following these guidelines helps our team and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/HALRobotics/Beta/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined that your bug is new or related to a closed issue, create an issue and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to minimal files which reproduce the problem or screenshots if you believe the problem is local to your machine.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting that something crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system e.g. RhinoDotNetCrash.txt on your desktop until the Rhino Crash Reporting dialog is closed. Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of the Framework or an extension) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), or with large files or files with very complex toolpaths? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of the HAL Robotics Framework and its extensions are you using?** You can get the exact version in the HAL -> About menu or via the installer.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Which other plugins do you have installed?** You can get that list in Grasshopper by viewing the Solver tab in your Grasshopper Settings/Preferences.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the HAL Robotics Framework, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps the team and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/HALRobotics/Beta/labels/enhancement)** to see if the enhancement has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined that your enhancement suggestion is new or related to a closed issue, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of the HAL Robotics Framework which the suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to your fellow users.
* **List any applications where this enhancement or something similar exists.**
